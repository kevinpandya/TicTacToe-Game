# TicTacToe-Game
This is a simple 2-player TicTacToe game programmed in python. 
The tictactoe board is made as the numberpad on the keyboard where the the numbers 1 to 9 denotes the position on the tictactoe board.
For example, 1 = bottom-left
             3 = bottom-right
             5 = middle
             7 = top-left
             9 = top-right
The game can be played by 2 players turn by turn.
It will check for 3 consecutive 'X' or 'O' made in any row, column or diagonal.
If there are three consecutive 'X' or 'O' then the game will stop.
If the all the 9 blocks are filled and no one wins then also the game will stop.

You can restart the game after the game played before is over.
